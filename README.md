# VOIS_AeroSafe-AI-Triple-Fusion-Flight-Guardian-
AeroSafe AI – Triple Fusion Flight Guardian: Real-time risk prediction system combining aircraft, weather, and pilot analytics to make flying safer.

## 📌 Project Title  
**AeroSafe AI – Triple Fusion Flight Guardian**  

## ❗ Problem Statement (200 chars)  
Air crashes often occur due to three unlinked risks: aircraft failures, extreme weather, and pilot fatigue. No system exists that fuses these factors in real-time to predict risks early.  

## 🎯 Expected Outcome (255 chars)  
An AI-powered dashboard that fuses aircraft, weather, and pilot data to generate real-time flight risk scores and alerts. The system will provide 15–30 min early warnings to improve aviation safety.
